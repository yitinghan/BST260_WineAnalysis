```{r ,echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```


```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
merged <- read_csv("winequality_all.csv")
merged$red <- as.factor(merged$red )
fulldf <- merged %>% mutate(quality_group = cut(quality, breaks = c(0,4,6,10),labels=c("lo", "mid", "hi"))) 
data <- fulldf

```


```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
#  summary(fulldf$pH)
fulldf %>% ggplot(aes(pH)) + 
  geom_histogram( color = "blue",fill = "steelblue")
```

From the histogram and summary table, we see that the distribution of pH is approximately normal, with mean 3.219, median 3.210.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = fulldf, aes(x = quality_group, y = pH, color = quality_group)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

We don't see a significant difference in the distribution of pH value among different wine quality groups.
